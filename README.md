# tc-rally_game

A rally game for DiamondFire, written in
[Terracotta](https://github.com/Owlfroggy/terracotta). The cars are built from
separate parts, so they can be damaged and broken apart.

## Layout

| Path | Contents |
| --- | --- |
| [car/](car/) | Car design: [README](car/README.md), [part list](car/PARTS.md), `parts.json` for the game code |
| [pack/](pack/) | Resource pack (Minecraft 26.3, format 97.1), namespace `rally` |
| [pack/src/car_parts.py](pack/src/car_parts.py) | Generates the car models, textures and part data |
| [tools/viewer/](tools/viewer/) | 3D viewer for the car models |

## Build the car

```bash
python3 pack/src/car_parts.py
```

Needs Python 3 with Pillow. It rewrites the files under
`pack/assets/rally/`, `car/parts.json`, `car/PARTS.md` and
`tools/viewer/car_data.js`.

## View the car

```bash
python3 -m http.server 8765 --directory tools/viewer
```

Then open http://localhost:8765. Drag to orbit. Click a part for its data, and
double-click it to break it off. The controls explode the car, show the
damaged models, ghost the body to show the mechanics, and change the paint and
accent colors.
